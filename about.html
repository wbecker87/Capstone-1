<h1>About</h1></a>
<p>My name is Whitney. I am a wife and a mother. My husband and I have two children together. I grew up in South Carolina with my mother, stepfather, and brother.  </p>

<p>Growing up, I enjoyed both indoor and outdoor activities. I loved drawing, reading, and listening to music. I also loved going outside and finding new adventures. I would say I’m still that same kid at heart—I still love drawing and reading, and whenever I get the chance to leave the house, I take my time and enjoy the drive. I am currently taking online courses to learn web development. I became interested in this field because I have a two-year-old son who was born with health issues, which has made it difficult for me to leave the house. </p>

<p>Learning web development will hopefully allow me to work from home.My goal is to become a full-stack web developer within the next couple of years. The past few years have been challenging, and I am ready to live a more stress-free life. I can’t wait to see where my skills take me!</p>

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging in activities that foster both creativity and continuous learning. I have an interest in video games, which allows me to explore interactive storytelling and strategic thinking. Music is another passion of mine, as I find it both inspiring and relaxing. Additionally, I am actively learning how to code, continuously developing my problem-solving skills and expanding my knowledge in the field of technology. Cooking is another hobby I enjoy, as it provides an opportunity to experiment with flavors and create enjoyable meals</p>
